# Running Cat
Running Cat is a game project made in Unity. The professor asked us to use a game as a reference and try to code it. 
The original game is called "Cat Runner". I download the character and animation in unity store and code the game by myself. There are three scenes in total - main, win and lose. The cat get one point each bone and 50 bones to win. If it hits three obstacles, then lose.
